The Office of the Mayor in Stockton, CA is seeking to differentiate and expand the City's investment opportunities, including potential capital from public (e.g. Transformative Climate Communities, AB 617), private (e.g. Opportunity Zones, startups), and philanthropic (e.g. foundations) sources, through the lens of **green economy**. The challenge at hand is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of Stockton's assets and opportunities across a wide range of industry, infrastructure, development, and policy domains which could be viewed as green economy investment opportunities. This would then enable City and community representatives to prioritize and drive evidence-informed discussions with environmental justice groups, prospective outside partners, and investors. In particular, there are opportunities to explore how data and insights gathered from this framework could inform cutting-edge educational opportunities as well as research & development efforts. The net benefits here are an informed community, demonstrable short-term projects that generate environmental and economic benefits, long-term alignment with future educational initiatives, and further investment interest.

City Systems has conducted a research activity with the following intended outcomes:

1. An active repository of data to inform green economy investment opportunities, including: relevant technical review, practical case studies of implementation in other cities, key risks/challenges, and estimated ranges of possible environmental and economic benefits per dollar of investment.
2. Education & communication materials for Stockton's City representatives, community stakeholders, and partners to use in external outreach.
3. A decision-making aide for a series of green demonstration projects in the short-term (2020-2022) informed by consensus-building discussion with local stakeholders.
4. Guide the discussion on what it would look like for Stockton and San Joaquin County to build a green economy lab in the region that addresses aggressive GHG reduction and creates jobs and workforce opportunities for residents.

Additionally, robust background reading is available in the City's 2014 [Climate Action Plan](http://www.stocktongov.com/files/Climate_Action_Plan_August_2014.pdf). It's also recommended that this green economy analysis is paired with the 2019 [Sustainable Neighborhood Plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hroKcJ2fpoxKp8Mae2_cit8TJ0l7TpHe/view?usp=sharing) to get a sense of current and evolving community priorities.

## Approach

The goal of every urban government is to provide residents a high quality of life, which not only includes the benefits associated with high-quality jobs, but also a vibrant economy filled with excellent amenities and supported by well-maintained infrastructure. Building a robust business tax base is one recognized strategy in California for cities to adequately fund general expenses and capital infrastructure, given, for example, state restrictions on property taxes. This strategy is particularly relevant to Stockton given its history of bankruptcy following the Recession and its "brain drain" challenge of keeping high-quality talent from leaving for economic opportunities in the Bay Area and elsewhere. One useful related indicator is the jobs to employed residents (J/ER) ratio; the higher this ratio, the greater the share of business and sales tax relative to property tax, and the less likely the region is a "bedroom community" in which there are more people at night than during the day. For reference, a city like San Jose is unique to have its metropolitan core location yet have a J/ER ratio less than 1; nearby cities like Palo Alto approach a J/ER ratio of 3. 

If Stockton is to reinvent its economy, a key goal should be to increase its J/ER ratio while ensuring the quality of those jobs. To do so, it must aggressively attract high-quality businesses and support the growth of its existing ones, so that its number of jobs may increase more quickly than its population. Historical data for both population and jobs will help us understand the baseline performance of Stockton and its surrounding region in this regard, as well as allow us to forecast what "business-as-usual" looks like into the future. Then, J/ER ratio targets can be set in comparison to business-as-usual, which can be achieved through the kinds of economic development strategies explored in this report.

Of course, both job and population growth directly impact a city's environmental footprint. In Chapter 2, we will prepare a baseline assessment of Stockton's greenhouse gas inventory, our primary indicator of environmental performance. Importantly, GHGs should be disaggregated as much as possible into residential and non-residential (commercial, industrial, agricultural) sectors and normalized by respective populations (residents vs. workers) to understand the GHG use per capita in these different sectors. Stockton's GHG footprint will almost certainly increase in the coming decades simply due to the increase in jobs and population, but if GHG/capita for each sector can be reduced through the kinds of strategies explored in this report, then it should be considered successful in curbing GHGs -- and perhaps the City's GHG footprint may actually decrease as a whole.

So, in summary, an accurate assessment of current population and jobs, combined with a GHG inventory, helps us measure important indicators of success like J/ER and GHG/capita. And a best estimate of how population and jobs will change in the future shows us what business-as-usual looks like for both economic and environmental health. Given this outlook, Stockton can consider a wide range of possible strategies that stimulate job growth, reduce our environmental footprint, or in the best case scenario, achieve both at the same time, all categorized under the term **green economy**. The effects of those strategies can be modeled into the future in comparison to business-as-usual to see if they help us achieve our economic and environmental targets. Of course, strategies will also need to be evaluated based on their costs and return on investment, which we will approximate as a $/tCO2e (metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent) in net-present value, similar to the work done in [Climate Smart San Jose](https://www.sanjoseca.gov/your-government/environment/climate-smart-san-jos). After robustly carrying out the quantitative analysis involved, this report will highlight the most promising strategies at the intersection of "green" and "economy" so that future decision-makers can take actionable steps towards a vibrant and sustainable future.

# Baseline Assessment

The first step to our research is to conduct a baseline assessment of Stockton's environmental and economic performance, and produce "business-as-usual" forecasts. Different datasets will be limited to different historical ranges and geographic scales. We will explain all key assumptions made in data processing. For forecasting, we will generally rely on simple regression and will project to 2040, a common planning horizon.

## Population and Jobs

The following analysis first processes population and jobs data at the County (SJC) level, where it is more readily available, followed by estimations at the City level. 

### County-level Analysis

The following datasets were collected for SJC:

- [Total Population, American Communities Survey, 1-Yr Estimates, 2010-2018](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs)
- [Population projections for US counties, 2020-2100](https://osf.io/9ynfc/)
- [Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Origin-Destination Employment Statistics, 2010-2017](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/), available at the block level

A few notes on methodology and assumptions:

1. From the ACS, we collected Total Population, Total Population 16 and Older, Total Employed Residents (16+), and Unemployment Rate (for 16+). In order to forecast the future number of employed residents, which would then be used to forecast the future number of jobs, we chose to perform a linear regression on employment rate projecting to 2040, given that the unemployment rate was significantly more variable from 2010-2018.
2. Population projections come from a [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20195) published in Nature in 2019. The specific methodology is beyond the scope of this project to unpack. What's notable is that five different projections were made by the author based on diferent "potential futures involving various growth policies, fossil-fuel usage, mitigation policies (i.e. emission reductions), adaptation policies (i.e. deployment of flood defenses), and population change". We used the "Middle of the road" projection.
3. Projections from the above study were available in 5-year age groups. While the total population projection is directly used in the final table below for SJC, Population of 15+ was also collected which was multiplied by the previously projected Employment Rate (#1) to forecast total Employed Residents. Note that given data limitations we have a discontinuity between Population 16+ data from 2010-2018 and Population 15+ data from 2020-2040. We assume this difference is negligible for the purposes of our analysis, but it would have the effect of overestimating job count.
4. From LODES we collected "Primary Jobs" at the block group level and aggregated all jobs for block groups in SJC. These are meant to match the number of individual workers in a region. We also compared this number to the number of employees provided by the [Quarterly Workforce Indicators](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/qwi.html) dataset and the number of nonemployer establishments in the [Nonemployer Statistics](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/cbp-nonemp-zbp/nonemp-api.2017.html) dataset. The LODES Primary Jobs number was higher than the QWI Employee count but lower than the QWI Employee count plus Nonemployer Establishments count, which seems to make sense (since an individual could operate multiple nonemployer establishments).
5. We calculated J/ER for 2010-2018 by dividing total Jobs by Employed Residents. Then, we chose to perform a linear regression on J/ER ratio projecting to 2040, and multiplied this by our projected Employed Residents (#3) to forecast total Jobs.

The following figure compares the J/ER ratio for SJC and its neighboring counties since 2010. SJC is toward the lower end of the group. It appears that all of these counties are stagnant or decreasing in this metric, and are all "bedroom counties" in the sense of being net exporters of workers during the day.

### City-level Analysis

The Nature journal population projections from the previous section are not available at the City level; in this case we chose to assume that Stockton's missing data was proportional to the related data we had at the County level. Otherwise, to scale our analysis down to Stockton, we collected data at the block group level. The following block groups were manually selected to represent Stockton.

```{r bgs, fig.cap = "Block groups used to represent Stockton population estimates. The red outline is the official city boundary."}
stockton_boundary <- 
  places("CA", cb = TRUE) %>%

  block_groups("CA", cb = TRUE)[stockton_boundary_buffer,c("GEOID")] %>%

Stockton's jobs to employed residents ratio trend for 2010-2018 is notable; while it has been higher overall than the County's J/ER ratio this decade, it has been trending slightly downwards where the County's has been trending upwards. One possible explanation would be that Stockton has received an influx of residents who are working outside of Stockton; perhaps such residents have been displaced further from their place of work, and have moved to Stockton where they could find more affordable housing. Further analysis would be necessary to test this explanation and others. It's also important to acknowledge that many good jobs held by Stockton residents may be just outside of official Stockton borders, in the industrial zones and neighboring cities, which still contribute to the local economy; that is why it's useful to look at both the city and county levels. But if this preliminary analysis is indicative of a growing imbalance, then Stockton should focus on aggressive strategies to reverse the trend and bring more quality jobs within its borders.

Estimation of the average earnings of Stockton jobs is not possible using the QWI data from the previous section, which is only available at the County level. However, using LODES data, we can recreate a table of job counts by top-level NAICS industry sector (20 total).

## Green Jobs

While there are many possible ways to identify "green jobs", this report uses the [Bureau of Labor Statistics Green Jobs Initiative](https://www.bls.gov/green/home.htm) classification of 333 NAICS industries which it has determined to potentially contain jobs that meet its definition of green jobs:

- Jobs in businesses that produce goods or provide services that benefit the environment or conserve natural resources.
- Jobs in which workers' duties involve making their establishment's production processes more environmentally friendly or use fewer natural resources.

Specifically, those 333 potential industries were classified into the following sub-categories:

- 58 in "Energy from renewable sources"
- 140 in "Energy efficiency"
- 124 in "Pollution reduction and removal, greenhouse gas reduction, and recycling and reuse"
- 75 in "Natural resource conservation"
- 45 in "Environmental compliance, education and training, and public awareness"

The following six tables filter the full Quarterly Workforce Indicators dataset to just the BLS-classified sectors, as well as further filtering in these five sub-categories. The top green job sectors span agriculture, building trades, and scientific research. This analysis is at the County level because the QWI data is only available at that scale. Overall, 15% of the jobs in SJC would be classified as "green jobs" using the BLS criteria.

## 2005-2016 GHG Inventory

The State of California Governor's Office of Planning and Research recommends that California local governments follow ICLEI's [Community Greenhouse Gas Emissions Protocol](http://icleiusa.org/) when undertaking their greenhouse gas emissions inventories. ICLEI helped to produce Stockton's most recent [GHG Inventory in 2016](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Zbb6apJ1eAT0BgLPOmBE0IYkDKZooUhd) which was compared to the previous inventory produced by ICF for the 2005 baseline year. The results from that report are copied below.

It is not within the scope of this project to formally update the 2016 ICLEI GHG Inventory for 2018, which is best completed by ICLEI or another similar organization. In fact, many of the significant components of ICLEI's formal GHG analysis, like "Water Energy" for example, are simply based off of an interpolation of population changes, given the lack of official data -- in other words, it is similar to what we have already done to project GHGs to 2040. We believe the following three focus areas are essential:

1. Normalization of the emissions by the incremental unit of activity, which is usually population, to understand the baseline rate of GHG emissions per actor. Unless we intend to directly limit the number of actors, these activity emission rates are fundamentally the factors that determine how large Stockton's footprint is. The reduction of activity emissions rates therefore becomes the critical problem to solve, either through behavior change, technology, or other means. We have already normalized overall emission sectors by jobs and population, but to get to the level of concrete green economy strategies, we will need to disaggregate further by specific key activities. The next few sections pursue this goal, focusing on some of the largest emitting activities: passenger vehicle driving and building energy.
2. Focusing on activity emissions rates also requires having direct measurement data in those same activity sectors to be able to calibrate our rates. For the two sectors we will focus on in the subsequent sections, passenger vehicle driving and building energy, there are fortunately recent public data sources we can use to calibrate our baseline rates, and we can expect these data sources to be available in the future so we can check whether rates have fallen in the ways we will have been hoping for, given our various strategic interventions. Part of our contribution through this project is to prepare scripts that can more easily update measurements in the future as soon as new public data is available, so that feedback can be obtained as efficiently as possible. These scripts also essentially help to update the most significant components of an overall GHG inventory analysis.
3. Since the availability of direct measurement data is critical to both the updating of GHG inventories and the understanding of the efficacy of our investments, we should also seek to increase the availability of direct measurement data in the sectors in which it is less readily available. These areas include industrial energy consumption (which is often restricted because of the California Public Utilities Commission's 15/15 rule, which means that utilities cannot provide data at aggregations with fewer than 15 customers or one customer greater than 15% of usage), water consumption (given the existence of private water providers), and waste production specific to Stockton residents (given that data is collected at the landfill but isn't disaggregated by truck routes or individual properties). These are all areas with opportunity for novel data sharing agreements to be negotiated by the City (e.g. the [PG&E Green Communities Program](https://www.pge.com/includes/docs/pdfs/mybusiness/environment/whatyoucando/greencommunities/GreenCommunities_SummaryPlanningReports.pdf), which effectively will enlist PG&E to directly complete the 3 steps outlined here for Stockton's building energy sector), and these efforts will improve the overall green economy initiative.

The following table shows a preliminary normalization of the 2005 and 2016 GHG emissions by residents and jobs, using the following allocation:

- Residential Energy and Transportation were allocated entirely to residents
- Commercial Energy, Agriculture, and Fugitive Emissions were allocated entirely to jobs
- Solid Waste and Water/Wastewater were distributed proportionally between residents and jobs
- Industrial Energy was not included, given the significant difference in methodology between 2005 and 2016 as documented by ICLEI

Based on the allocation assumptions, it appears that emissions per resident has decreased by 3.8% between 2005-2016, while emissions per job has decreased by 23%. These are both good signs, though there are gaps in the GHG inventories. Next, it is useful to drill down into the sub-sectors to reveal deeper insights.

## Origin-Destination Commute Analysis

As seen in the previous section, transportation is the largest single contributor of GHG emissions in Stockton, [as is true for all of California](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/ghg-inventory-data). Within this sector, passenger vehicle emissions are by far the largest portion, and these are relatively easy to relate to their direct proxy, vehicle miles traveled (VMT), and normalize by drivers to understand current driving behavior. Specifically, commutes (driving to work) are the largest share of passenger vehicle emissions (other driving to/from amenities can be analyzed separately), and we can access data as recent as 2017 to understand commute patterns of Stockton residents to different job destinations inside and outside of SJC. What we find is that VMT is significant, and significantly locked in to the nature of job opportunity in faraway locations like the Bay Area. This means that VMT reduction is a crucial component in any overall green economy strategy, and it can be tackled directly through transportation strategies like public transit and EV deployment, but also indirectly by attracting high-quality jobs to Stockton, which on average will shift workers from faraway jobs to local jobs, thereby reducing VMTs. A comprehensive origin-destination commute analysis, as performed below, helps us quantify total VMTs attributable to commuting as well as model the specific impacts of different direct or indirect VMT reduction strategies.

In this section, we first examine the distribution of job locations for SJC in comparison to neighboring counties, as well as Stockton in particular. The following section will then analyze vehicle miles traveled for these commute trips.

### County-level Analysis

Our key dataset is from [Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Origin-Destination Employment Statistics](https://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/) (LODES), which can be downloaded by state and is available up to 2017. 

Some reported workplaces in LODES are as far away as Los Angeles County and are likely data errors (e.g. the company headquarters is in Los Angeles but the actual workplace is much closer, or the employee works from home). These workplaces are left in the datasets shown in this section, but are removed later when calculating VMTs.

The LODES dataset also disaggregates jobs by three age groups:

- Number of jobs of workers age 29 or younger
- Number of jobs for workers age 30 to 54
- Number of jobs for workers age 55 or older

It also disaggregates jobs by three wage tiers:

- Number of jobs with earnings $1250/month or less
- Number of jobs with earnings \$1251/month to $3333/month
- Number of jobs with earnings greater than $3333/month 

It also disaggregates jobs by three broad sectors:

- Number of jobs in Goods Producing industry sectors
- Number of jobs in Trade, Transportation, and Utilities industry sectors
- Number of jobs in All Other Services industry sectors

The following table shows the counts of jobs in these subcategories that are held by SJC residents traveling to a workplace in SJC or its top 14 contiguous neighboring counties. The percent jobs shown are percentages of SJC employed residents; so of all SJC employed residents, 48% work within SJC.

### City-level Analysis

The following table shows the counts of jobs in these subcategories for the top 15 contiguous neighboring counties to Stockton, including SJC. Note that the jobs being counted are those held by Stockton residents who are traveling to a workplace in the listed regions. 41% of Stockton employed residents work within Stockton. These jobs could be considered valuable for avoiding the "brain drain" of local talent to other places, as well as for creating the smallest transportation footprint.

The following maps help to visualize the specific distribution of Stockton residents' jobs in the categories of age, earnings, and industry sector. 

37% of younger (under 29) Stockton employed residents work within Stockton, and another 15% work outside of Stockton but within SJC. Beyond that, there are higher concentrations of these younger workers in Sacramento and Alameda County compared to other neighboring counties.

```{r stockton-lodes-w-top-counties-youth, fig.cap="Top 13 counties where Stockton residents work, not including SJC - percent of overall jobs for Stockton workers age 29 or younger located in workplace. Data from LODES, 2017."}

46% of lower-wage (less than $1,250/month) Stockton employed residents work within Stockton, and another 13% work outside of Stockton but within SJC. Beyond that, there is a higher concentration of these lower-wage workers in Sacramento County compared to other neighboring counties.

38% of higher-wage (greater than $3,333/month) Stockton employed residents work within Stockton, and another 12% work outside of Stockton but within SJC. Note these percentages are lower than the percentages of lower-wage jobs that remain local. Beyond that, there is a higher concentration of these high-wage workers in Alameda County compared to other neighboring counties. Perhaps targeted marketing of businesses that are providing these higher-wage jobs in Alameda County to move to Stockton could be an effective investment.

While LODES origin-destination data doesn't provide job types at a granularity lower than the three broad industry sector categories in the previous three maps, one possible assumption to make is that the distribution of NAICS industry sectors in a destination block group, which is available through the separate Workplace Area Characteristics dataset from LODES, is the same distribution for specifically Stockton residents who work in that block group. Using this assumption, we created estimates of the locations of specific types of industries and wage levels for Stockton employed residents.

The following table summarizes the number of Stockton workers estimated in each NAICS industry, by wage level.

The percentages in the table below should be interpreted as the % of overall jobs held by Stockton residents of that industry sector and wage tier that are based in Stockton (the remainder being based in other counties). Particularly notable here are the low-percentage estimates of high-wage jobs in sectors generally related to the "knowledge economy": Finance and Insurance (27%), Information (28%), and Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services (16%). Also notable is the low percentage of high-wage jobs in Construction (24%), which may include specialized building trades such as solar installation. These percentages are relative to an overall 51% of high-wage jobs being based in Stockton, which suggests that the best jobs in these notable industries are significantly underrepresented in the local economy.

## Commute Vehicle Miles Traveled

Building off the Origin-Destination Commute Analysis from the previous section, we isolated every unique pair of SJC or Stockton home block groups and work block groups and used the [Open Source Routing Machine](http://project-osrm.org/) to compute a distance (in miles) and duration (and hours) for a one-way trip. Using this analysis, combined with some estimates of mode choice (single-occupancy vehicle vs. carpool vs. other), we created estimates of vehicle miles traveled for a certain number of jobs and were able to see how see how SJC and Stockton residents have changed their driving behavior over time, and how that behavior has compared to neighboring counties. Finally, we used VMT to estimate the GHG footprint of commuting for Stockton residents. 

Our analysis in this section focuses on destinations with average commute times of less than 3 hours, which eliminates the unrealistic commutes while preserving more than 90% of reported commutes. We suspect that many of the other commutes with purported destinations like Los Angeles County are erroneously reported, and the actual workplace location is unavailable to us. Note, however, that it could be true that some workers commute to southern California, though not every weekday, and it also could be true to some workers commute by flight, which presents its own distinct and potentially significant GHG analysis which is outside the scope of this report.

### County-level Analysis

The following table shows commute data for SJC residents from 2011 to 2017, including estimates of the number of total jobs held by residents, the number of those jobs that are car-dependent, and the number of those jobs that are carpooled (according to ACS). The routing analysis provides distances between each origin and destination, which are totaled up to person miles traveled. The conversion to vehicle miles traveled is based on the following assumptions:

- For each origin-destination block group pair, we used ACS 1-yr 2017 data on commute mode by travel time for the origin block group to estimate a share of travelers commuting by single occupancy vehicle and by carpooling, and applied this factor to the count of jobs from LODES to estimate a total number of vehicle trips and vehicle mildes traveled (VMT).
- For carpool trips, we counted 2-person carpools as 1 vehicle for every 2 jobs, and 3-or-more-person carpools as 1 vehicle for every 3 jobs.

The following figure shows one-way commute VMT/job for SJC and its neighboring counties from 2011 to 2017. Note that this VMT/job ratio divides VMTs equally among all car-dependent jobs, leaving out non-car-dependent jobs (never more than 10% of jobs, as can be seen in the previous table).

SJC is at the top of the figure, 25 miles/job in 2017, vying with Stanislaus County to have the highest average commute distance per car-dependent worker.

One of the possible contributions to an increasing VMT/job isn't necessarily further away jobs but less carpooling to get to those jobs. The following figure shows that the percent of car-dependent SJC workers who carpool has declined from 2015 to 2017, similar to Stanislaus and Sacramento County.

The map below demonstrates the extent of geographic spread of Stockton residents across the greater Northern California region, potentially on a day-to-day basis. Most of the tracts shown have only a handful of estimated Stockton workers, but interesting concentrations of workers can be seen by zooming in and hovering over areas like the East Bay.

```{r stockton-jobs-map, fig.cap="Tracts where Stockton residents work - number of jobs. Data from LODES, 2017."}
stockton_jobs_map <-
  stockton_lodes_h_filter %>% 
  group_by(w_tract) %>% 
  summarize(
    `Jobs held by Stockton residents` = sum(S000, na.rm=T)
  ) %>% 
  left_join(ca_tracts, by = c("w_tract" = "GEOID")) %>%
  st_as_sf()

# map = mapview(stockton_jobs_map[,c("Jobs held by Stockton residents")], zcol = "Jobs held by Stockton residents", col.regions = colorRampPalette(c("snow", "black", "grey")), map.types = c("OpenStreetMap"), legend = TRUE, layer.name = 'Jobs held by</br>Stockton residents')
#

The previous map can be considered in combination with the map below, which essentially shows the average distance in miles traveled one-way by Stockton workers to those tracts. Evidently, workers traveling to further-away tracts are responsible for a disproportionate share of the transportation emissions compared to other Stockton workers.

```{r stockton-commute-avg, fig.cap="Tracts where Stockton residents work - average commute time, in hours. Data from LODES, 2017."}
stockton_commute_avg <-
  stockton_lodes_h_filter %>% 
  group_by(w_tract) %>% 
  summarize(
    `Average Commute Time, Hours` = mean(duration, na.rm=T)
  ) %>% 
  left_join(ca_tracts, by = c("w_tract" = "GEOID")) %>%
  st_as_sf()

# map = mapview(stockton_commute_avg[,c("Average Commute Time, Hours")], zcol = "Average Commute Time, Hours", map.types = c("OpenStreetMap"), legend = TRUE, layer.name = 'Average Commute</br>Time, Hours')
#

Similar to the county-level analysis, we calculated the change in VMT/job over time, which might give more important relative insight given the many assumptions that go into the specific quantity of VMTs in any given year.

```{r stockton-commute-vmt-table}

    `Workers` = prettyNum(round(jobs,-3), big.mark=","),
    `One-Way VMT/Workers` = round(vmt/jobs_car,1),
    `% Car-Dependent Workers who Carpool` = paste0(round(jobs_carpool/jobs_car*100,1),"%")
  )

  stockton_commute_vmt_tractmode_table,

The average one-way commute trip for the Stockton worker appears to have increased by 13% over the last 6 years. This could be explained by existing residents changing to jobs that are further and further away from home, where better employment opportunities can be found, and by new residents moving to Stockton to find affordable housing but retaining their faraway jobs.

The following figure compares Stockton and SJC VMT/job. The trends are similar, though Stockton residents commute less distance than SJC residents overall.

## Non-Commute Vehicle Miles Traveled

While commute-related driving is the primary way cities currently evaluate their GHG transportation footprint, residents also do a significant amount of non-commute-related driving, which also has its own GHG footprint. We are developing a methodology to produce an order-of-magnitude estimation of VMTs associated with Stockton residents traveling to places of economic activity, such as grocery stores and restaurants. 

The full analytical methodology is still being refined and deserves its own separate report to detail, but generally follows these steps:

We used 2018 [Safegraph](https://marketplace.arcgis.com/listing.html?id=3425348e4bee4059af2b353e52df43c2) data to collect trip visit data to amenities in and around Stockton by Stockton residents. Safegraph reports total visits from its panel of monitored devices each month, which can be weighted to represent the full population. It indicates any census block group which is the origin of more than 5 monitored devices in a given month, which can be used to estimate the routes and VMTs for Stockton visitors, similar to how origin-destination data is used in the commute VMT analysis. We also applied revision factors to the analysis to account for: (1) converting Safegraph
s reported median travel distance to mean; (2) linked trips, such as dropping by the grocery store and library on the same trip, which reduce the total VMTs; (3) carpooling; and other factors.

The map below shows the location of all points of interest in California that had recorded visitors from Stockton in 2018. Each point is colored and sized based on the VMTs we calculated associated with Stockton visitors; purple/small is low, yellow/large is high.

The following map shows the same data aggregated back to Stockton blockgroups, and shown as VMT per capita. For most of Stockton there is no clear pattern, but some there are notable block groups at the periphery that have high VMT per capita. Transit and ride-sharing strategies, or land use policy and development that brings needed amenities closer to where people live, could target VMT reduction where it is needed the most.

Overall, the VMTs associated with non-commute travel in 2018 sum up to about 1.2 billion, compared to an estimated 2.2 billion for commute travel, a roughly 1:2 ratio. This preliminary work suggests that strategies to reduce non-commute travel, which may be much more actionable for local cities, may have impacts up to half the size of commuter-oriented strategies, and should not be ignored.

## Vehicle Emissions

The previous two sections estimated the total VMTs due to commuting for Stockton workers from 2011 to 2017, and non-commuting travel for 2018, which can be used to forecast VMTs through 2040. While VMTs themselves are an important indicator of quality of life and economic vitality, from a GHG perspective we need to convert vehicle miles to emissions.

We followed the standard method for calculating vehicle emissions in California using the California Air Resources Board (CARB) [Emission Factors (EMFAC) model](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/mobile-source-emissions-inventory/msei-modeling-tools). Using the EMFAC2017 model, we downloaded emissions rates data for 2013-2018, 2020, 2025, 2030, and 2040 in the San Joaquin Valley air basin. The data includes CARB's model estimates for daily vehicles across passenger cars and trucks of different fuel types, along with emissions per mile for CO2 and other pollutants. A summary of the EMFAC data is provided below.

```{r emfac}
emfac <- read_csv("C:/Users/Derek Ouyang/Google Drive/City Systems/Stockton Green Economy/emfac.csv")

emfac_summary <-
  emfac %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    Year = `Calendar Year`,

    `Percent Vehicles` = round(Population/sum(Population)*100,2) %>% as.numeric(),
    `gCO2 Running Exhaust` = CO2_RUNEX %>% as.integer(),
    `gCO2 Start Exhaust` = CO2_STREX %>% as.integer()
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  dplyr::select(-Population, -CO2_RUNEX, -CO2_STREX) %>%

Emissions from N2O and CH4, along with emissions from other types of vehicles, were left out of this analysis. 

We applied the CO2 emission rates above to our 2017 commute VMTs to estimate the total and average GHG emissions for Stockton workers commuting to each of the top 15 counties (filtering out counties further than 3 hours away). We made the following assumptions:

- Assuming that the distribution vehicle types for Stockton commuters matches the EMFAC breakdown, the average GHG emissions is about 440 g/mile running exhaust, and 93 g/trip start exhaust.
- For daily VMT, each vehicle was assumed to take 2 one-way trips.
- To convert daily VMT to annual VMT, the same annualization factor was used as ICLEI: 369.39. The factor appears to account for both expected reductions in VMT because of sick days, as well as expected increases in VMT because of chained trips.

The following table is sorted by total annual GHG from transportation.

According to the table above, 59% percent of Stockton residents work in San Joaquin County and collectively contribute 19% of all commute GHGs. The next 14 counties comprise another 39% of Stockton residents, but they collectively contribute 73% of all commute GHGs. This significant difference comes down to difference in average commute distance to each county, which is directly related to average GHG emissions per worker. In a later section, we will explore opportunities to stimulate local job creation so that some of these long-distance commutes can be converted into local commutes, reducing both the toll on the environment and the tolls on health and well-being for Stockton residents.

To conclude this section, we plotted changes in emissions per mile (just running exhaust) and the percentage of electric vehicles in San Joaquin County from 2013-2040. These projections will contribute to modeling business-as-usual GHG emissions. Later, one of our strategies will model the GHG reductions associated with even more progressive EV adoption beyond 5% by 2040.

The projected busines-as-usual increase in electric vehicles on the road is a driver of the reduction in emissions/mile, namely because this electric vehicle adoption increase corresponds to a decrease in use of gasoline vehicles. However, based on a basic contribution analysis, the shift to EVs is roughly responsible for 14% of the overall gCO2/mile running exhaust reduction from 2020 to 2040 (399 to 256 gCO2/mile), while fuel efficiency improvements to gasoline vehicles is roughly responsible for 86%. This is a reminder that while EV adoption is an important driver, unless adoption can triple, improving fuel efficiency of new gasoline vehicles, retiring old vehicles, and simply reducing the amount of driving will play a greater role in reducing transportation emissions.

## Energy

After transportation, buildings are the next largest source of emissions based on the ICLEI GHG inventories. Our best source of energy data is from [PG&E's Energy Data Request Program](https://pge-energydatarequest.com/public_datasets), which provides total customers, total kWh of electricity, and total therms of gas usage per zipcode per month dating back to 2013. We used the following zip code tabulation areas (ZCTAs), close proxies of customer zip codes, to represent Stockton.

```{r zcta, fig.cap = "Zip code tabulation areas used to represent Stockton population estimates. The red outline is the official city boundary."}
zcta <- zctas(starts_with="95") %>% 
  mutate(ZCTA5CE10 = as.numeric(ZCTA5CE10))
# zips_stockton <- st_read("C:/Users/Derek Ouyang/Google Drive/City Systems/Stockton Green Economy/ZipCodes/ZipCodes.shp") %>% st_transform(st_crs(zcta)) #this was downloaded from Stockton GIS site to do a quick visual check of the difference between ZCTA and zip code. We determined they were pretty much the same.

PG&E's data had some minor formatting errors that were manually corrected:

- For 2014 Q3 Gas, fields "Total Therms" and "Average Therms" renamed to match the fields in all other datasets.
- For 2017 Q4 Electricity and 2017 Q4 Gas, duplicate September values were removed.

Also, because of privacy regulations, the PG&E data has many gaps in industrial and agricultural energy usage. Even though industrial energy usage may be a significant contributor to emissions, as the ICLEI report suggests, without more consistent data we decided to leave industrial energy analysis out of our report. 

After downloading and aggregating the PG&E residential and commercial data by month and year, we converted electricity and gas energy usage to tCO2e. For gas, we converted therms to tCO2e based a factor from the [U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/environment/emissions/co2_vol_mass.php) (assuming that PG&E's natural gas emits at this rate, and that it doesn’t change from year to year). For electricity, we converted kWh to tCO2e for the appropriate year using the table provided by PG&E in their [2019 Corporate Responsibility Report](http://www.pgecorp.com/corp_responsibility/reports/2019/en02_climate_change.html), under the table titled "Benchmarking Greenhouse Gas Emissions for Delivered Electricity". Because the latest emissions data is 210 lbs CO2 per MWh for 2017, and SB 100 signed into law September 2018 requires state energy agencies to adopt a 100 percent clean energy by 2045 planning goal, we assume the emissions factor will decrease by 7.5 lbs CO2 per MWh each year, resulting in a value of 202.5 for 2018.

The graphs below illustrate that total energy usage (in kBTU) for electricity and gas has stayed roughly level across the last six years, but given that electricity has become cleaner through renewable power sources, the overall carbon footprint of electricity has decreased dramatically in comparison to gas.

The following graph plots monthly tCO2e for electricity vs. gas. The peaks in gas usage occur in January, corresponding to heating load, and the peaks in electricity usage occur in July, corresponding to cooling load, and overall decreasing as previously noted. As we'll explore in a later section, electrification of air and water heating in buildings may be a particularly effective strategy to shift the peak gas consumption to less carbon-intensive electricity loads.

Note that heating and cooling loads, which appear to contribute to significant seasonal variation within years, is also heavily dependent on the specific weather in any given year, typically measured in heating degree days (HDDs) and cooling degree days (CDDs). A more accurate comparison of annual energy consumption would control for change in HDDs and CDDs year-to-year; a more accurate forecasting of energy consumption into the future would also factor in climate model predictions of future HDDs and CDDs.

We used the [Cal-Adapt Degree Day tool](https://cal-adapt.org/tools/degree-days) to collect HDDs and CDDs for Stockton from 2010 to 2018, and on to 2040, using the average simulation (CanESM2) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario (in which global GHG emissions peak around 2040, then decline). The graph below shows the data from Cal-Adapt, as well as linear trendlines, with a clear overall upwards trend for CDDs (meaning that temperatures are rising and more cooling power is needed), and a clear overall downwards trend for HDDs.

The following table shows historical 2013-2018 annual energy usage per capita (residents for residential energy, jobs for commercial energy) per degree day (HDDs for gas, CDDs for electricity), and the graph that follows shows these four energy use factors with downward trends. This may be through a combination of changing building energy efficiency as well as changing building utilization (e.g. more or less space per occupant), though we don't have the data to be able to separate these two factors.

A full forecast of energy usage will also depend on predicted changes in resident and job populations, which will lead to more buildings and more energy used in buildings, predicted changes in building energy efficiency and utilization, predicted changes in weather, and many other factors that are outside the scope of this analysis. One last available dataset to incorporate into our understanding of energy use relates to buildings.

## Buildings

2018 data from the local County Assessor's Office includes property use type and total building square footage for every parcel in Stockton. Because the assessor's record of total building square footage is of poor quality, we chose to instead use [Microsoft's U.S. Building Footprint Data](https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints), joined each building footprint to a parcel (thereby also assigning a residential or commercial type based on the zoning of the parcel), and multiplied this footprint area by number of stories, which came either from the assessor's record or from the Microsoft data. This dataset may still contain significant errors (e.g. mixed use parcels are mis-identified, the stories record may be incorrect, Microsoft's building footprints may be incorrect, etc.), but we decided it was the best representation of total building square footage in Stockton. 

The following maps show the density of residents per acre across Stockton, followed by the density of jobs per acre of commercials buildings, at the block group level. Residential population was obtained from ACS 2017 5-yr data, and job count was obtained from LODES 2017.

```{r residential-density, fig.cap="Stockton residents per 1,000 sqft of residential building area, per block group."}

#note that when combining into SECTOR, say electricity and gas for commercial, the summary function for TOTALCUSTOMERS switches to max(), with the reasoning that many of these commercial customers have both electricity and gas, so we would assume that the correct total # of customers is closer to the max of either, than to add them together (which presumes that there are no overlapping electricity and gas customers).

Because we do not have robust historical building datasets, we cannot analyze the change in building square footages over time. For forecasting, we assumed an overall fixed building utilization estimate of 1.7 residents per 1000 sqft of residential buildings, and 1.3 jobs per 1000 sqft of commercial buildings. In the intervention stage, if we expect a strategy would change building utilization, we would make a reduction in energy consumption relative to these baseline utilization rates.

As one last couple of building-specific analyses, we aggregated building square footage information up to the zipcode level and compared with energy usage data to see residential and commercial building energy efficiency at a recent snapshot of time, spatially distributed across Stockton.

```{r res-customer, fig.cap="Stockton residential kBTU per sqft of residential building area, per zip code."}

## GHG Forecast

For our "business-as-usual" forecast of GHG emissions through 2040, and for our subsequent exploration of intervention strategies, we will focus on the following sectors for which we have used available data to refine our models: transportation, commercial energy, and residential energy. These sectors represented 58% of ICLEI's modeled emissions in 2016. The other sectors, particularly industrial energy which comprised 24% of 2016 emissions, are also significant opportunities for GHG reductions, but are outside of the scope of this analysis without better data.

Our simplified model of transportation emissions assumes that commute one-way vehicle miles traveled per worker is on a linear trend based on recent data. Otherwise, our forecasts of growth in the number of employed residents drives changes in VMT and thus transportation emissions. Other "business-as-usual" factors, like a forecasted adoption of EVs, are not considered in this analysis.

Our simplified model of energy emissions will assume that building square footage increases with population and job growth through fixed ratios, and an underlying energy use factor for commercial and residential electricity and gas will follow the same trends as the last six years through 2040. Otherwise, a basic climate change model of heating and cooling degree days will drive additional changes in the forecasts.

In summary, the following assumptions go into inputs for the 2020-2040 forecast:

| Section | Assumption | Source/Reasoning |
|:------|:---------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|
| [2.1](#population-and-jobs) | Population increases | [Nature study](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata20195) by Mathew Hauer. Includes a "middle of the road" assumption for global sustainability. Population 15+ is used specifically to forecast employment. |
| [2.1](#population-and-jobs) | Employment rate increases | Our choice: employment rate increases linearly based on trend from 2010-2018. |
| [2.1](#population-and-jobs) | Job to employed residents ratio decreases | Our choice: J/ER ratio decreases linearly based on trend from 2010-2018. |
| [2.5](#commute-vehicle-miles-traveled) | Commute one-way VMT per worker increases | Our choice: Commute VMT/worker increases linearly based on trend from 2011-2017. |
| [2.6](#non-commute-vehicle-miles-traveled) | Non-commute VMT per resident stays constant | Our choice: Without trend information, we assume non-commute VMT/resident stays constant. Further analysis pending data collection is likely to reveal an upwards trend over the past few years. |
| [2.7](#vehicle-emissions) | GHG per vehicle mile decreases | CARB [EMFAC2017](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/mobile-source-emissions-inventory/msei-modeling-tools) model forecasts declining emissions rates based on assumed alignment with state and federal regulations. |
| [2.7](#vehicle-emissions) | Electric vehicle adoption increases | CARB [EMFAC2017](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/mobile-source-emissions-inventory/msei-modeling-tools) model forecasts increasing EV adoption based on regressions on historical data. |
| [2.8](#energy) | PG&E electricity emissions factor decreases | Our choice: We assume a linear forecast which runs from 2017's reported factor towards a 2045 target of 100% clean energy. |
| [2.8](#energy) | Heating and cooling degree days | [Cal-Adapt](https://cal-adapt.org/tools/degree-days) forecasts using the average simulation (CanESM2) under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 scenario |
| [2.8](#energy) | Energy use per capita per degree-day decreases | Our choice: combining climate, energy, and population/jobs data, we found downwards trends between 2013-2018 and assumed these trends to continue to 2040. For Commercial Gas, we leveled out the forecast at 1 kBTU/job/HDD from 2035 on. |

The table below shows the results of the various assumptions above on quantitative inputs for each year, which are used to calculate GHG emissions.

The general insight is that transportation emissions are expected to increase while building emissions are expected to decrease, such that transportation emissions is even greater relative to buiding emissions than it is today.

Many differences in inputs exist between this analysis and ICLEI's 2016 GHG Inventory, including the following:

- ICLEI's VMT data came from a source that was only available at the SJC level and was scaled down to Stockton by population, whereas our VMT data is based on the routed distance of LODES origin-destinations. The difference these methods results in is significant (2.5 billion vs. 1.5 billion annual VMTs) and should be investigated in further work. Our Transportation tCO2 number is only for passenger commuters, whereas ICLEI's number includes many other modes.
- ICLEI's electricity and gas data was obtained directly from PG&E, while ours was downloaded at the zip code level from their public data portal. Since our zip codes include many parcels outside of the Stockton city boundary, it's likely our consumption is for a larger population. As for commercial energy, ICLEI's commercial data was combined with industrial data, while ours is separated, so that could explain why our commercial consumption numbers our lower.

The assumptions built into these forecasts are necessarily simplistic given the scope of this analysis. In particular, linear trendlines should be refined into nonlinear functions given a better understanding of growth limits for each of the domains. It's also worth noting that some trends based on the past few years, like the desirable decline in building emissions, may be heavily influenced by active strategic policymaking, the kind which this report is meant to guide for the future. That means that "business-as-usual" is not necessarily "doing nothing" but "successfully continuing to implement progressive policies" (e.g. PG&E successfully meeting its aggressive decarbonization strategies).

This chapter provides a survey of over fifty green economy strategies that have been implemented, or are being considered, in over eighty cities and regions across the U.S. and beyond. It is organized by overall strategy domain (with explanations for why the domain is chosen) and by specific strategy (where cities with similar examples as the primary case study are grouped together). In Appendix A, this list is re-organized by city or region. 

Given the focus of this body of research on Stockton's green economy strategies, we generally prioritized searching for city-level initiatives over state or federal level policies and private sector initiatives. Compared to the technical analysis elsewhere in this report, which focuses on the GHG footprints of building and transportation and job geography, the strategies in this overview span a broader range of "green" topics, including water and resilience.

Among many others, the following knowledge sources were researched in the development of this survey:

- [American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy](https://database.aceee.org/)
- [Better Buildings Challenge](https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/challenge)
- [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/)
- [City Observatory](http://cityobservatory.org/)
- [CityLab](https://www.citylab.com/)
- [Clean Cities Coalition Network](https://cleancities.energy.gov/)
- [Meeting of the Minds](https://meetingoftheminds.org/)
- [MRDC](https://www.mdrc.org/)
- [National Bureau of Economic Research](https://www.nber.org/)
- [National Resource Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/)
- [Pew Charitable Trusts](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2019/11/19/mitigation-matters-policy-solutions-to-reduce-local-flood-risk)

- [Shared-Use Mobility Center](https://sharedusemobilitycenter.org/)
- [UCLA Luskin Center for Innovation](https://innovation.luskin.ucla.edu/)
- [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/)

The following chapter will revisit each strategy domain with a focus on specific strategies that can be technically evaluated using the quantitative approach that has been developed in Chapter 2, and that may be applicable to Stockton. While this deeper analysis cannot be applied to all the strategies researched in this chapter, we believe the handful that are detailed are good starting points for Stockton's green economy initiative in the 2020s.

## Employment Growth

This domain covers strategies with the outcome of increasing the employment rate for the resident population, such as job training. While this strategy domain generally is not restricted to “green” strategies and can include employment strategies that provide broad economic benefits to Stockton, this report ultimately will focus on “green jobs” in particular. In addition, any strategies that increase employment opportunity and employment wages can increase the purchasing power of households, enabling them to invest in many of the other GHG reduction strategies considered in this report.

| Details | WorkAdvance is a sector-based workforce development model that continues training and support post-employment. The developers of the program focused on sectors with strong demand for entry-level and middle-skill employees and relatively short training time. For this program, they focused on transportation & manufacturing, IT, environmental remediation, and healthcare. The program itself has five components including: (1) Intensive screening of program applicants for motivation and readiness; (2) Sector appropriate pre-employment and career readiness, including orientation to the sector and career advancement coaching; (3) Sector-specific occupational skills training aligned with employer needs and leading to certifications that are in demand in the regional labor market; (4) Sector-specific job development and placement services based on strong relationships with employers; and (5) Post-employment retention and advancement services, including ongoing contact, coaching, skills training, and rapid reemployment help if needed. |

## Vehicle Miles Traveled

This domain includes transportation-oriented strategies that lead to fewer vehicle miles traveled, such as public transit improvements, transportation demand management, and carpooling incentives. Electrification of vehicles is considered as a separate domain. Land use strategies that reduce sprawl are also part of this domain.

### Create local transportation demand management ordinances

| Location | Pasadena, CA |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | Transportation Demand Management can include a variety of ordinances designed to reduce traffic congestion, increase safety and mobility, and conserve energy and reducing greenhouse gases. The Pasadena TDM focuses on encouraging alternative modes of transportation, such as transit, vanpools, carpools, and bicycles, as well as encouraging alternative work hours to reduce typical peak period demands upon the roadway network. The Trip Reduction Ordinance requires preferential parking spaces for carpool vehicles, providing employees with commuter-matching services and trip reduction information, and providing bicycle parking facilities and/or other non-auto enhancements. |
| Links | [LA Metro](https://www.metro.net/projects/tod-toolkit/tdm-ordinance/) |
| Implementation Costs & Impact Factor | Besides legislative work, no implementation costs. In 2014, 40 projects were subject to the City of Cambridge's Parking and TDM Ordinance Large Project TDM Plans. Of those, 35 projects, or 88 percent completed monitoring reports. Of the 35 projects, 30 projects exceeded non-drive-alone mode split commitments. [Read more here](https://default.sfplanning.org/transportation/tdm/TDM_Technical_Justification_update2018.pdf) (Table 3-3). |

### Redesign bus network to prioritize ridership over coverage

<br>Source: [NACTO](https://nacto.org/case-study/metro-bus-network-redesign-houston/)

| Location | Houston, TX |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | After an extensive community engagement process, the METRO Board of Directors directed the System Reimagining team to design a network where 80% of resources are aimed at maximum ridership and 20% of resources are used for coverage (compared to about 50%-50% today). The result is a simpler, easier to understand network that better aligns with the Houston of today. At all times, the plan strives to keep service to as many existing riders as possible. |
| Links | [Houston METRO Transit Systems Reimagining Project](https://www.ridemetro.org/Pages/Reimagining-FAQs.aspx) |
| Implementation Costs & Impact Factor | The draft plan presented here is a no-growth network plan, which means it is designed to use existing METRO operating funds. The plan reallocates existing service rather than imagining new resources. That’s why the plan doesn’t always offer as much service as METRO or its customers would like. Nearly all (94%) current riders will be able to access service at the same stop they do now. The vast majority of current riders (72% up from 49.5% on weekdays and 25% on weekends) will be on or near frequent service that is useful for travel to more places than they can reach easily now. Even if you are already on a frequent line, the plan makes it much easier to transfer to other lines to get to more places. 99.5% of existing riders will have local bus service within 1/4 mile. The small percentage that will be farther from service either live or travel in areas where the pattern of development and the street network make it impossible to run transit efficiently, and as a result they could only be served at a very high cost per rider. About 0.6% of existing riders will have flexible service rather than fixed route service. This service will provide hourly pickups and dropoffs within its defined zone and to reach a point where you can connect to fixed route service. Riders can call ahead to reserve a ride on the service or meet the bus at a designated location and time. Some fixed routes will still run in these zones, but the flexible service will fill in the gaps for those who might find it difficult to walk to a bus stop. |
| Scalable Potential | San Joaquin RTD is still recovering from budget cuts, but can consider a bus network redesign that is budget-neutral and maximizes ridership. |

|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | Bus rapid transit is a system that allocates designated lanes to buses and light rail, in order to make for faster travel on bus. Additionally, off-board fare collection is key to reduce delay caused by passengers waiting to pay on board. |

| Implementation Costs & Impact Factor | [RTD has planned](http://sanjoaquinrtd.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/SRTP-2018-Update_FINAL.pdf) for about $30 million of BRT service expansion between 2019-2026. When fully deployed, RTD's BRT routes will create a high-frequency network covering the major arterials of the County, connecting them with central Stockton. RTD projects almost 3.7 million annual trips on the BRT network by FY 25. By attracting new riders, RTD's BRT network can eliminate over one million tons of carbon emissions. |
| Scalable Potential | BRT service is currently planned for a range of corridors throughout the City of Stockton, with potential service extension to Lodi via BRT Express. RTD will implement BRT Express service over time as funding becomes available and as demand grows due to new development. Therefore, BRT design may differ by corridor but should follow a set of requirements to ensure system characteristics remain consistent. |

<br>Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congestion_pricing)

| Location | New York City, NY |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | New York placed tolls in two locations that are typically congested. 80% of the funds from tolling will go to capital projects while 20% goes towards the public transit system. Drivers can only be tolled once per day. Additionally, toll exemptions are made for emergency vehicles, drivers with disabilities, and those who make under $60,000 per year. The goal of the program is to reduce congestion by encouraging the use of carpooling and public transit. |
| Links | [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/nyregion/what-is-congestion-pricing.html) |
| Implementation Costs & Impact Factor | Mayor Bloomberg's [2008 proposal](https://web.archive.org/web/20080305132512/http://www.transalt.org/campaigns/congestion), based on an \$8 charge for entering Manhattan south of 86th Street, place dannual revenue from the charge at roughly \$400 million in the first year and up to \$900 million by 2030. When a congestion charge is implemented, a small but significant number of motorists alter the time of their commute to avoid the charge, or adopt a more efficient means of transportation such as walking, bicycling or mass transit. This relatively small decrease in traffic leads to an enormous reduction in delays and congestion. Mayor Bloomberg's proposal anticipated a 6.5% reduction in the number of vehicles entering Manhattan south of 86th Street, and an even more dramatic during peak hours when an 11% traffic reduction would result in a 20-40% reduction in time loss to traffic delays. |
| Scalable Potential | Because Stockton is not currently a concentrated job center, congestion on local roads is not a significant issue. |

|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | Cities that charge for parking have realized an increase in the use of public transit for commuting (r-squared of .83) and a reduction in commuting alone. This is made more effective when they eliminate zoning requirements about parking and change the cost of parking over the day. In New York, sensors have allowed the tracking of parking spaces, bringing vehicles directly to open parking spaces, rather than having them drive around looking for a spot. |

The Carsharing Implementation Strategy documents were outlined in a report to MTC’s Board which reviews the development and current state of carsharing in the Bay Area, explores regional challenges and opportunities as they apply to various carsharing business models (round-trip, one-way, and peer-to-peer), presents findings from interviews and workshops with stakeholders in the region, and provides specific strategies to support the expansion of carsharing. The Carsharing Strategy is intended to identify opportunities to grow carsharing membership and usage in the Bay Area as a method of reducing single-occupancy vehicle trips and vehicles miles traveled, with the overall goal of reducing greenhouse gases. |

The impact on ridership is yet to be determined. |
| Scalable Potential | Free transit could be feasible in Stockton given the relatively low transit ridership numbers for RTD compared to high-density cities. It's unclear how the loss in revenues would affect service quality and ridership.

| Location | San Diego, CA |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | Approximately 8,000 intelligent sensors are being installed to transform the City’s streetlights into smart infrastructure that will help optimize traffic and parking, plus enhance public safety, environmental awareness and overall livability for San Diego residents. These intelligent sensors, or CityIQ nodes, can see, hear and feel the heartbeat of a city. The node connects city officials and citizens to real-time data, allowing for endless applications. In addition to the intelligent sensor installation, approximately 25 percent of San Diego’s outdoor lights will be upgraded to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The City of San Diego has retrofitted approximately 38,000 light fixtures with energy efficient lighting of which, 3,500 are currently equipped with advanced lighting control systems. |
| Links | [City of San Diego](https://www.sandiego.gov/sustainability/energy-and-water-efficiency/programs-projects/smart-city) |
| Implementation Costs & Impact Factor | The Intelligent Outdoor Lighting Project makes San Diego one of America’s most energy-efficient cities and saves $2.8 million in annual energy costs due to the more efficient lighting. The City will avoid or minimize future costs of installing one-off point solutions i.e. in-ground parking sensors, pedestrian detection infrared, inductive loop surveillance at intersections, CCTV video cameras, and more. In the long term, the compounding app economy, cost avoidance for single-purpose technology deployment, real-estate development planning models, and small businesses and retail store location optimization tools have the potential to bring increased revenue and jobs to the region. |
| Scalable Potential | The City of San Diego's smart city digital infrastructure will make it easier for residents to find parking, higher utilization of parking spots, and streamlined parking management. Based on experiences with prior deployments of similar technology solutions, the City expects a 40 percent reduction in time spent looking for parking. San Diego's smart sensors will provide valuable data to enhance traffic flow. Studies conducted by application providers indicate that there’s potential to improve traffic by 10-20 percent by optimizing city management of traffic and providing en-route guidance improvements. Less traffic also means lower greenhouse gas emissions. The impact of this is significant, and reduced traffic will improve air quality and associated health and productivity benefits. |

## Local Jobs

This domain includes strategies with the outcome of increasing the number of jobs based in Stockton. This is distinct from the previous section because local job creation may be attracting companies and workers who aren't necessarily Stockton residents, so as to increase the jobs to employed residents ratio.

### Offer job creation tax credit

`r include_graphics("images/incentives.png")`
<br>Source: [Brookings](https://www.brookings.edu/research/examining-the-local-value-of-economic-development-incentives/)

| Location | Philadelphia, PA |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | Philadelphia's Job Creation Tax Credit rewards businesses that increase the number of jobs available in the City. A business firm can apply this credit to its Business Income and Receipts Tax (BIRT) liability if it either creates 25 new jobs or increases its number of employees by at least 20% within five years of the designated start date. Program participants must commit to maintaining business operations in the City of Philadelphia for five years. The credit amount for jobs created is 2% of annual wages paid for each new job or $5,000 per new job created, whichever is higher, subject to the maximum amount specified in the commitment agreement. |

| Implementation Costs & Impact Factor | Cost depends on the size of tax credit expansion. [Estimates](https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1356&context=cahrswp) suggest that the tax credit creates between 0.13 and 0.3 new jobs at participating firms, primarily for workers 25 and younger. Many of these workers, however, would have been hired without the credit. It is likely that as firm size grows, economies of scale will allow job creation to increase exponentially as the marginal cost of adding an additional employee decreases. |
| Scalable Potential | In California, taxpayers with 20 or fewer employees at the end of the preceding taxable year may qualify for a nonrefundable new jobs credit against the personal income tax and corporation franchise and income taxes for each new qualified employee that is hired. It is equal to \$3,000 for each net increase in qualified full-time employees from the previous taxable year. It is only applicable to firms with 20 or fewer employees (see Sec. 23623, California Rev. & Tax. Code). There have been several proposals for implementing a similar system with local corporate taxes. As of 2018, the [Stockton-Lodi MSA](https://www.labormarketinfo.edd.ca.gov/LMID/Size_of_Business_Data.html) has 2132 business with other 20 employees, 159,052 employees in those businesses, and payrolls equal to $1,830,930,000. |

<br>Source: [DFI](https://dfi.wa.gov/financial-education/information/mortgage-refinancing-basics)

| Location | San Francisco, CA |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | Mortgage refinancing encourages consumers to take out a new loan to take advantage of lower interest rates. This creates a wealth effect whereby they develop greater disposable income. From a Keynesian perspective, this leads to more consumer spending in the local economy. The corollary to this is that growth in aggregate demand leads to job growth, or at least stability. HUD has a class on First-Time Homebuyer Education and Counseling. |

### Develop public employment program

<br>Source: [SFHSA](https://www.sfhsa.org/services/jobs-money/jobsnow)

| Location | San Francisco, CA |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | A public employment program places unemployed, willing-to-work, workers in in-demand jobs across the community. In post-Keynesian thought, the job creation element of a public employment program is two-fold. On one hand, you are giving participants a job. On the other hand, their increase in discretionary income leads to greater aggregate spending and by extension, an increase demand for employment in sectors where money is being spent. Additionally, due to macroeconomic overemployment, it is important to target such a program to those who experience structural unemployment, not frictional. |

| Implementation Costs & Impact Factor | [See table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wRfHpgLv4xkIYSVeNFy-1X3LqU5UAzVUOMWzD9nOe30/edit). Assuming that there wouldn't be a resulting increase in labor force participation (unlikely), this could impact about 18,000 individuals. Keep in mind that this would mean exceeding full employment. |
| Scalable Potential | According to CAP data, the ratio of children under 5 to available childcare slots in Stockton is 6.5. This would necessitate growth in the childcare industry. The Old Age Dependency ratio is 20.3, suggesting that the demand for healthcare services will rise in Stockton, even though there is a statewide shortage of healthcare workers. Most theorized public employment programs, particularly those that occur on a federal level, do mention the importance of building/rebuilding infrastructure. |

| Details | The Economic Development and Government Equity Program (ED/GE) serves as a tool to make the County more competitive and enhance cooperation among local jurisdictions. The ED/GE program consists of two parts. The “ED” side consists of grant funding generated by sales tax revenue. The “GE” side is a tax-based sharing formula that calculates disbursements based on income and property tax valuations. |

Since its [inception](https://www.mcohio.org/news_detail_T6_R154.php) in 1992, the program has assisted in the creation of 24,000 private sector jobs and retained over 30,000 private sector jobs through \$2.8 billion in leveraged investment. Impact estimated at 900 new jobs throughout the County. |
| Scalable Potential | A [USC study](https://socialinnovation.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Orfield-Tax-Base-Sharing-Final.pdf) simulating a tax-based sharing program in the Los Angeles region assumed that 40 percent of the growth in local sales tax bases from each local area in the metropolitan area between 2003 and 2013 was allocated to a regional pool. The pool was then distributed back to localities based on their shares of the region’s population. Local sales tax base disparities are so dramatic that even this relatively benign distribution formula would result in increases in the local tax bases of communities serving fully 72 percent of the region’s population. |

## Building Utilization

Building Utilization refers to the amount of building space used per person throughout their daily activities. Specific types of building energy uses like heating and cooling are proportional to space use, and strategies to reduce the amount of space required per person, whether at home or at work, that do not sacrifice comfort can be effective ways to reduce emissions. However, the more profound impact of space efficiency is the densification of all urban activities, which may have an even greater emissions impact by reducing travel distances, as well as many potential social co-benefits.

| Location | Davis, CA |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | Shared equity housing is a model used by nonprofit housing associations and municipalities targeting first-time buyers, those with bad loan or credit history, and those who can’t afford downpayments. Typically, a nonprofit or government entity provides a subsidy to lower the cost of purchase through shared appreciation loans, which are second mortgages provided by a public agency that buyers repay in full at the time of resale along with a percentage of home value appreciation. These funds are reinvested to make home ownership more affordable to another low-income buyer.<br><br>`r include_graphics("images/shared-equity.png")`<br>Mortgage vs. home price index.

| Implementation Costs & Impact Factor | The Davis cooperative is independently run. In San Francisco, the Mayor's Office BMR program subsidizes homes at about $250,000 below their appraised value. According to the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/sharing-equity-future-generations-evaluation-long-term-affordable-homeownership-programs-usa), homes that were passed between shared equity owners remained affordable over time, delinquency and foreclosure rates were low, and families who sold their homes were able to use the proceeds to purchase market-rate homes. |

The ADM Illinois ICCS project includes the design, construction, and demonstration of a CO2 compression and dehydration facility as a precursor to CO2 storage and subsequent monitoring, verification, and accounting of the stored CO2. The injected CO2 will come from the byproduct from processing corn into fuel-grade ethanol at ADM’s biofuels plant adjacent to the storage site in Decatur, Illinois. This gas stream will be compressed and dehydrated to deliver supercritical CO2 to the injection wellhead for storage. The injection operations will be conducted on a 200-acre site adjacent to the ethanol plant, which is also owned by ADM. Because all of the captured CO2 is produced from biologic fermentation, a significant feature of the project is its "negative carbon footprint," meaning that the sequestration results in a net reduction of atmospheric CO2. Integral to the project will be the formation of an educational and training facility, the National Sequestration Education Center, at nearby Richland Community College in Decatur. The center will contain classrooms, training, and laboratory facilities, and it will offer students associate degrees in sequestration technology. The ADM Illinois ICCS project is located in Decatur, Illinois. Partners include: Schlumberger Carbon Services, Illinois State Geological Survey (ISGS), and Richland Community College (RCC). |

In California, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) enables CCS projects to generate credits that have traded on average between \$122-190/tCO2 in 2018-2019. On top of LCFS, federal 45Q credits worth \$31/tCO2 for geological storage are expected to increase in value and scale, with estimates that the U.S. Treasury will provide between \$3.5-5 billion per year of tax credits starting in 2025. |

### Develop pneumatic waste collection systems

| Location | Wembley Park, UK |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | Wembley Park’s automated waste collection system serves a mixture of residential, retail, and hotel properties with more than two and a half miles of underground tubes. It has the capacity to handle nearly 6,000 metric tons of waste and recycling per year — and its recycling rate is double the U.K. average. The system’s pneumatic tubes are powered by large vacuum pumps located in the collection center. The pumps are powerful enough to transport waste at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour. That requires a lot of electricity, but the pumps don’t operate continuously; rather, they run only as the system’s valves are opened. Wembley Park’s vacuum waste system consumes 300 kilowatt hours of electricity daily. That’s about one-tenth of a kilowatt-hour per day for each residence served by the system, roughly equivalent to the consumption of a 100-watt incandescent lightbulb for 70 minutes. |

| Implementation Costs & Impact Factor | The up-front capital costs for the Envac system amounted to more than \$16 million. Once built, however, its operation has come at substantial savings: that same Brent Council study pegged the operational cost of the Envac system at under \$275,000 per year, compared to the nearly \$900,000 annual cost of curbside collection. To make the finances work, the borough and the developer arrived at a unique arrangement: the developer would pay for the system’s construction and operation, while the borough would pay for part of the collection service. In Wembley Park, truck movements for waste collection have been reduced by 90 percent, saving more than 400 tons per year in carbon dioxide emissions. That figure is expected to rise to nearly 700 tons per year once the redevelopment is complete. |
| Scalable Potential | North America remains a laggard, but some promising projects are underway. Typically, installing pneumatic systems in older urban districts can be a more expensive proposition than a new, large-scale redevelopment, since it requires retrofitting existing underground infrastructure to accommodate the vacuum tubes. |

### Charge for waste disposal except recycling and compost

| Location | Seoul, South Korea |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Details | In 1995, South Korea replaced its flat tax for waste disposal with a new system. Recycling materials were picked up free of charge, but for all other trash the city imposed a fee, which was calculated by measuring the size and number of bags. By 2006, it was illegal to send food waste to landfills and dumps; citizens were required to separate it out. The new waste policies were supported with grants to the then nascent recycling industry. Residents of Seoul can buy designated biodegradable bags for their food scraps, which are disposed of in automated bins, usually situated in an apartment building’s parking area. The bins weigh and charge per kilogram of organic waste. The thirteen thousand tons of food waste produced daily in South Korea now become one of three things: compost (thirty per cent), animal feed (sixty per cent), or biofuel (ten per cent). |

| Implementation Costs & Impact Factor | These measures have led to a decrease in food waste, per person, of about three-quarters of a pound a day—the weight of a Big Mac and fries, or a couple of grapefruits. The country estimates the economic benefit of these policies to be, over the years, in the billions of dollars. |
| Scalable Potential | Mandatory organics recycling could save money. Sanitation trucks would have waste to pick up throughout the city, as opposed to gathering bits and pieces from participating households. (Organics collection currently averages between one and two tons per truck shift, a fraction of the capacity of ten to twelve tons.) There’s even a small amount of money to be made from selling compost, though for now much of it is given away in the interest of generating enthusiasm and awareness. |

# Analysis of Green Economy Strategies

While the previous chapter is presented as a broad overview of different green economy strategies from locations across the U.S. and other countries, this chapter hand-picks a limited subset of strategies to examine in greater detail. These strategies are selected because of their ability to be modeled using the same framework as developed in Chapter 2, as well as their identification as practical options for Stockton by Stockton stakeholders. After a description of how the strategies will be quantitatively evaluated within our existing GHG framework, the following sections are once again organized by domain of green economy strategies. Each section introduces key model assumptions, and then a specific set of recommended strategies are modeled in terms of their possible impact on GHG reduction and economic benefits. Where possible, short-term and operational costs are also estimated.

More strategies will be analyzed over time. Refer to the Conclusion (Chapter 5) for a list of upcoming analyses.

## Methodology

Chapter 2's baseline assessment has already set up the framework for how we will evaluate the effectiveness of any green economy strategies we might consider. Whatever the strategy may be, it would need to have a predicted positive effect on one of the variable inputs in our GHG model. The following diagram shows those variables highlighted in yellow, and their business-as-usual trends as up/down arrows.

```{r diagram, fig.cap="GHG model diagram."}
include_graphics("images/diagram.jpg")
```

$~$

- Employment % was observed in ACS data as the ratio between employed residents and population 16 and older. Using a simple linear assumption, the employment rate increases to 72% in 2040. As a point of comparison, the U.S. 2018 employment rate was ~ 70%. To maintain even this "business-as-usual" trend may depend on aggressive strategies like workforce training and education initiatives. Otherwise, this is considered a variable that can be influenced through specific employment growth strategies. Note that employment rate affects the number of employed residents, which particularly affects VMTs in the GHG model.
- Increasing Jobs to Employed Residents Ratio is different from increasing local employment rate as it can also include attracting workers who are not Stockton residents to commute to Stockton. Economic development strategies to attract new businesses would be an example of a type of strategy that influences the GHG model through this variable. J/ER affects the number of jobs in Stockton, which particularly affects commercial building emissions in the GHG model. If those local jobs are increasingly held by Stockton residents, it also implies that VMTs have been reduced.
- Commute One-Way Vehicle Miles Traveled is modeled using the LODES origin-destination data, so any predictions of changes in the distribution and concentration of jobs would affect this variable. Other transportation strategies such as increasing carpooling or transit ridership would also affect this variable.
- Vehicle Emission Rates is modeled based on EMFAC2017 projections of improvement in miles-per-gallon and EV adoption over the next two decades. Any active strategies to improve the fuel efficiency of Stockton commuter-owned vehicles and to increase EV adoption above expected rates would affect this variable.
- Building Utilization and Building Energy Efficiency are built into the variables of Energy Use per Capita per Degree Day as "hidden variables" that can't easily be isolated without more data, but any strategies directed at reducing the amount of floor space per capita, or increasing floor area ratio on sites, or retrofitting buildings can be predicted as affecting Building Utilization or Building Energy Efficiency, which in turn would proportionally affect Energy Use per Capita.
- Energy Emission Rates also affect the ultimate emissions estimated out of some amount of energy use. We have already incorporated PG&E's target to steadily eliminate the emissions associated with electricity use. Strategies that shift energy use from gas to electricity would result in quantitative changes at this leverage point in the model.

## Vehicle Emissions

### Strategy: Electric Vehicle Program

In Section 2.7, we used EMFAC2017 to estimate the penetration of EVs into the market in a business-as-usual situation from now till 2040, reaching about 5% in 2040. Any increase beyond this percentage would contribute to a further reduction in gCO2/mile, which would reduce the overall GHG footprint of Stockton's commute travel.

The following table shows how transportation tCO2 changes in 2040 with different EV penetration percentages. This model assumes that the distribution of vehicle types (car vs. truck, gasoline vs. diesel) does not change apart from the increase in percentage of EVs. For example, within gasoline vehicles, about 70% are projected to be cars and the rest are trucks; we do not change that assumption as we decrease the number of gasoline vehicles overall.

```{r vehicle-electric-forecast}
non_electric <-
  emfac_summary %>% 
  filter(Year == 2040) %>% 
  filter(`Fuel Type` != "Electric") %>% 
  pull(`Percent Vehicles`) %>% 
  sum()

emfac_modify <-
  c(0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45) %>% 
  map_dfr(function(x){
    temp <-
      emfac_summary %>% 
      filter(Year == 2040) %>% 
      mutate(
        `Percent Vehicles` = `Percent Vehicles`*(1-x/non_electric),
        product = `Percent Vehicles`/100*`gCO2 Running Exhaust`,
        product2 = `Percent Vehicles`/100*`gCO2 Start Exhaust`
      ) %>% 
      group_by(Year) %>% 
      summarize(
        `gCO2/mile` = sum(product),
        `gCO2/trip` = sum(product2)
      ) %>% 
      left_join(ghg_forecast_prep %>% dplyr::select(vmtperjob, `Employed Residents`, Year,Population), by = "Year") %>% 
      mutate(
        `Percent EVs` = 5.19 + x,
        `gCO2/mile` = `gCO2/mile`,
        tco2 = vmtperjob * `Employed Residents` *2*369.39*`gCO2/mile`*1.1023e-6 + `Employed Residents`*2*369.39*`gCO2/trip`*1.1023e-6 + 4100*Population*`gCO2/mile`*1.1023e-6
      )
  })

emfac_modify_table <-
  emfac_modify %>% 
  transmute(
    `Percent EVs` = paste0(round(`Percent EVs`),"%"),
    `gCO2/mile` = round(`gCO2/mile`),
    `Transportation tCO2` = prettyNum(round(tco2,-4), big.mark = ",") 
  )

kable(
  emfac_modify_table,
  booktabs = TRUE,
  caption = 'Impact of increasing EV penetration by increments of 5% on commute GHGs in 2040.'
) %>% 
  kable_styling() %>% 
  scroll_box(width = "100%")
```

$~$

```{r vehicle-electric-forecast-plot, fig.cap = 'Impact of increasing EV penetration by increments of 5% on commute GHGs in 2040.'}
emfac_modify %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x = `Percent EVs`,
      y = `tco2`
    )
  ) +
  geom_line(size = 2, colour = "forest green") +
  labs(title = "Commute Emissions in 2040", y = "Transportation tCO2")
```

$~$

Note that while EVs can be effective at reducing gCO2/mile, transit strategies are even more effective because they reduce VMTs directly. Ultimately Stockton should proactively pursue strategies in both VMT reduction and vehicle emissions reduction because this sector of GHG emissions can use as many interventions as possible.

## Building Utilization

As seen in [Section 2.10](#ghg-forecast), Stockton's population is estimated to grow from 315,000 in 2020 to 339,000 in 2040, and Stockton's job count is estimated to grow from 125,000 in 2020 to 151,000 in 2040. The roughly 24,000 new residents and 26,000 jobs will of course have some baseline amount of energy use that can't be avoided, but the particular ways in which buildings provide for their needs can be made more energy-efficient through specific strategies. This section will focus on ways to reduce the amount of space required per person, which primarily affects energy usage because less heating and cooling is required. Less space per person implies a more dense urban form, which also brings transportation benefits, which we account for elsewhere in the model.

### Strategy: Accessory Dwelling Units

The 2019 California state legislative cycle resulted in [accessory dwelling units](#encourage-accessory-dwelling-units) (ADU) laws that took effect on 1/1/2020 and, among other changes, supercede local control to allow ADUs to be built on every single-family parcel. More specifically, local regulations cannot prevent a homeowner from applying to build an internal ADU of up to 500 sqft within their existing structure, as well as a detached ADU of up to 800 sqft in their backyard, with newly enforced maximum setbacks of 4ft from the side and rear. Exact regulatory details are still in flux as individual cities are expected to update their local ordinances to match the new state laws, and loopholes will inevitably come up; refer to [CA Housing and Community Development](https://www.hcd.ca.gov/policy-research/AccessoryDwellingUnits.shtml) for the latest guidance.

ADUs are being evaluated as a green economy strategy for the following key reasons.

First, internal ADUs such as garage conversions directly align with the goals of Building Utilization, making more effective use of existing built floor area and promoting less energy-intensive residential living. According to the [U.S. Energy information Administration's Residential Energy Consumption Survey](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=11731) (RECS 2009) (see figure below), the energy use per household in 2-4 unit dwellings is roughly half of the energy use of a single-family household, so we will use the same assumption when considering the energy impact of internal ADUs. In other words, every new internal ADU development that Stockton can enable will effectively increase household count without increasing overall energy use, assuming those households would have otherwise lived in newly built single-family homes. This liberal assumption can inform an upper-end estimate of the energy consumption benefits of internal ADUs.

```{r energy-use-duplex-diagram, fig.cap="Site energy use by housing type. Source: RECS 2009.", out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("images/energyuseduplex.png")
```

$~$

Second, detached ADUs, while not as effective as internal ADUs from a building utilization perspective, still are efficient compared to the average single-family dwelling because they are likely to have a smaller footprint in the constraints of backyard development. A robust model for the relationship between square footage and energy use is outside the scope of this study, so our simplified assumption will be as follows. According to the same RECS, [as analyzed by the National Association of home Builders](https://www.nahbclassic.org/generic.aspx?genericContentID=237901&fromGSA=1) (see figure below), about a third of single-family home energy consumption is for heating/cooling, while the rest is not significantly correlated with square footage. As previously estimated in [Section 2.9](#buildings), the average residential unit size in Stockton today is about 3,200 sqft (conservative because the data includes multifamily units) and consumes about 78,000 kBTUs per year. So we can estimate that a detached ADU of half that size, 1,600 sqft, would reduce its energy consumption by a sixth (to 65,000 kBTUs per year), and so forth.

```{r energy-sqft-diagram, fig.cap="NAHB analysis of HVAC vs non-HVAC energy use. Source: RECS 2009.", out.width = "100%"}
include_graphics("images/nahbenergy.jpg")
```

$~$

Third, ADUs of any type can be considered "infill growth" as they do not lead to expansion of existing urban boundaries or services. Considering transportation GHGs, we can assume that a household that lives in a new ADU will have the same transportation footprint as their neighbors, where otherwise they might live in newly-built housing that is likely to be further on the outskirts of town, away from jobs and amenities. For the purposes of this section, we will conclude by demonstrating that a progressive ADU strategy could target ADU development in the areas with the least amount of car-dependence, namely transit access to downtown and other neighborhood centers.

Fourth, homeowners who develop ADUs may realize a new stream of rent revenue, building wealth for local residents, while renters may benefit from lower rents because ADUs are a form of naturally occurring affordable housing. 

The fundamental question, then, is: how many new ADUs can Stockton actively enable in the next two decades that wouldn't have otherwise been built? It is unknown what the natural rate of ADU development is without local intervention, given the new state legislation; this remains to be seen in communities across the state as the laws have just taken effect. But for the purposes of our analysis, we will assume that the City of Stockton has a range of options from being the *least* supportive of ADU development (given that despite state legislation, local permitting processes, permit fees, information barriers, community opposition, and financial barriers could all work to curtail development) to the *most* supportive of ADU development (adopting many of the best practices [we reviewed in Chapter 3](#encourage-accessory-dwelling-units)), and we will quantify the size of that spectrum by estimating the number of ADUs that could be built based purely on physical characteristics of existing single-family parcels.

The following is a breakdown of the number of residential parcels by housing type, based on 2018 County Assessor Records. Note that the apartment parcels contain multiple units, so the number of total housing units or households is not represented in this table. Also, our data does not clearly indicate existing ADUs, so the analysis assumes that all single family parcels do not currently have ADUs. We suspect that the existing number of permitted ADUs is relatively low.

Starting first with internal ADUs, technically all 66,000 single-family, duplex, and apartment parcels could build permitted internal ADUs (in fact more than one can be allowed in existing multifamily buildings). These are by definition smaller units (less than 500 sqft, typically converting an existing garage, attic, basement, or master bedroom), so can't necessarily support larger household sizes. 

As projected in [Section 2.10](#ghg-forecast), only 25,000 new residents are expected between 2020 and 2040. In other words, it could be possible to support this entire population growth (with little increase in building energy consumption) if just half of all eligible existing buildings were to convert existing space to internal ADUs. Of course, for a number of reasons including lifestyle preference (with internal ADUs perhaps being the least palatable social arrangement for two separate households), this is not literally feasible, but should signal the opportunity in encouraging ADU development. 

Detached ADUs may be more palatable (along with attached ADUs which are additions to an existing home, but these are not considered in our analysis), given the greater privacy between households, greater square footage, and potential reduced complexity of new construction vs. retrofitting existing buildings, but are more costly as well. Assessing the viability of detached ADUs is more complicated because it involves geospatial analysis. 

We developed a script that performs the following basic steps:

1. We acquired Parcel shapes from the [City of Stockton GIS database](http://www.stocktonca.gov/services/gis/mapdatDat.html).
2. We acquired Building shapes from [Microsoft's U.S. Building Footprint Data](https://github.com/microsoft/USBuildingFootprints)
3. For each residential parcel, we produced the leftover yard area after removing 4ft setbacks, front yards (based on the closest distance from the existing building to the street edge), and the building (including a 5ft setback per municipal ordinances).
4. Using an 8ft x 20ft shape (like [the smallest ADU available on the market](https://mekamodular.com/models/standard/liberty-160/)), we traced this yard space to find the subset of space that can technically fit an orthogonal ADU design. This method does not account for obstructions like trees not represented in our data.
5. We aggregated and quantified the square footage of this remaining "buildable area".

The following map shows what the analysis looks like for one block group in South Stockton.

While the geospatial analysis is not perfect, and doesn't account for other possible obstructions in a backyard, this result can be used to roughly estimate the number of parcels that could build detached ADUs, and examine the characteristics of those potential ADUs.

We analyzed 85,625 residential parcels and found 64,188 with enough backyard space to build at least a 160 sqft ADU. The breakdown is shown below by area range. The cut-offs are based on market research showing the existence of a [576 sqft 2-bedroom ADU](https://californiamodulars.com/roma/) and a [989 sqft 3-bedroom ADU](https://californiamodulars.com/napoli/). With over 2000 sqft of space, a greener option would be to completely redevelop the site to a higher density use, like a low-rise apartment.

```{r buildable-area-summary}
buildable_area_summary <-
  clean_buildable_area %>% 
  mutate(
    `Buildable Area` =
      case_when(
        buildable_area < 600 ~ "160-600 sqft (studio or one bedroom)",
        buildable_area < 1000 ~ "600-1000 sqft (2 bedroom)",
        buildable_area < 2000 ~ "1000-2000 sqft (3 bedroom)",
        TRUE ~ "2000 sqft or more"
      )
  ) %>%

These numbers further suggest that there is more than enough space in residential backyards to support all the expected population growth in Stockton over the next 20 years.

Considering transportation footprint, Stockton could focus its outreach and incentives to the ADU-viable properties that are also extremely accessible to transit, so that the future ADU tenants are less likely to be car-dependent (this could be further ensured by restricting on-street parking and/or providing transit passes). For our demonstration, we defined this subset of the 64,000+ parcels as being within 15 minutes of walking + bus transit (with at least 20-minute frequency during commute hours) from Stockton's downtown bus station, which provides transfers to many other destinations around town as well a commuter bus to the Bay Area. Even with this heavy constraint, we found over 2,600 eligible parcels, as shown below.

Such sites are great opportunities to immediately conduct homeowner outreach to increase awareness of new state legislation and the opportunities associated with ADU development, including a possible source of wealth-building or living space for a growing family. This type of analysis could be scaled up to a city-wide strategy in partnership with Stockton's Community Development Department.

Below, we offer an example of how a progress ADU strategy could impact our GHG forecasts:

- The business-as-usual projection from [Section 2.10](#ghg-forecast) suggests that total residential building GHG emissions are already expected to decline from 209,000 tCO2/year in 2020 to 101,000 tCO2/year, driven by climate change that reduces gas heating needs, cleaner PG&E electricity, and continuing trends in energy efficiency improvements and building utilization.
- As previously noted, 25,000 new residents are projected during the same time, contributing to about 7,400 of the 101,000 tCO2 in 2040.
- As part of a steady stream of single-family home retrofits happening over the next 20 years (partially driven by energy efficiency strategies covered later), homeowners could be actively encouraged to also consider the conversion of an underutilized space in their homes into an internal ADU, at the same time as other renovations. If just 1% of the 60,000+ single-family homes were to take up this opportunity, 6,000 internal ADUs could be developed, creating highly energy-efficient dwelling opportunities for some of the residential growth (which may include cases of younger Stocktonians growing up and moving into an internal ADU in the same home they grew up in, or their aging parents moving into the internal ADU and giving the main home to their children to start a new family).
- At the same time, homeowners could be actively encouraged to consider the development of detached ADUs, which can accommodate an even greater range of lifestyle preferences. If just 1% of the 60,000+ property owners eligible for detached ADUs were motivated to build a detached ADU, 6,000 additional detached ADUs could be made available that wouldn't otherwise have existed.
- Assuming an average 2 residents per household, these 12,000 new ADUs could support nearly all of the new residential growth. Of course, other kinds of residential development can be expected elsewhere in Stockton during these two decades, particularly higher-density multifamily housing. But this ADU capacity could effectively mitigate any further development of detached single-family housing.
- Using our energy assumptions, 6,000 internal ADUs and 6,000 detached ADUs (assuming an average 600 sqft in size), compared to what could have been 12,000 new single-family homes, would only emit about `r prettyNum(floor((25000/339000*101000*(12000/25000)*(2/3+(1/3)*(600/3200))+25000/339000*101000*(1000/25000))/100)*100,big.mark=",")` tCO2 compared to 7,400 in business-as-usual -- a 2-3% reduction in 2040's residential building GHG footprint.
- While the GHG reductions in building energy are relatively low because of the progressive reductions already expected in business-as-usual, the combined transportation impacts of ADU development could be relatively significant. There is a projected increase of 59,000 employed residents between 2020-2040. If half of the 12,000 ADUs could support transit-based commuting (given their location, like the demonstration above) for at least 6,000 employed residents (one per household) who would have otherwise been car-dependent, the reduction in projected commute GHGs would be about 46,000 tCO2 in 2040, bringing the total GHG reduction associated with ADU development to 53,000 tCO2 (2-3% of Stockton's total tCO2 in 2016).

Regarding the cost of implementation, more research is needed to quantify the size and effectiveness of different types of expenditures, like outreach to homeowners and reduced permit fees. It is safe to say that ADU development is primarily a market-driven opportunity that can potentially increase a city's bottom line, since new ADU development can yield increased property taxes with less infrastructure development (pipes and roads) and urban servicing (police and fire) cost per unit compared to entirely new suburban growth. We recommend considering ADU promotion a net-zero $/tCO2 strategy, with each incremental ADU having the rough kinds of GHG benefits summarized in the table below:

| ADU Type | tCO2/year Reduction (in 2040) |
|:------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Detached ADU, 600sqft | 0.2 |
| Internal ADU | 0.6 |
| Detached ADU, 600sqft, transit-oriented | 7.8 |
| Internal ADU, transit-oriented | 8.3 |

## Building Energy

### Strategy: Electrification

Building electrification refers generally to the conversion of building systems and appliances that are powered directly by fossil fuels into alternative systems and appliances that are powered by electricity, which is becoming increasingly low-carbon. The primary opportunities for electrification are in suburban areas with old homes that have water and space heating powered by natural gas. Household heating fuel type in Stockton from 2018 ACS 1-Yr data is shown below.

```{r fuel}

The 65% of households with "Utility gas" represent the opportunity to replace space heating systems with electric alternatives like heat pumps, moving those households over to the "Electricity" category currently at 32%. The other households using other fuels like kerosene or biomass represent a very small number, but targeting these households may be particularly important because of the extra cost-effectiveness of electrification, and the likely co-benefits of improving health outcomes for a relatively more low-income and rural population. The California Public Utilities Commission is in the process of piloting projects to "[Identify Disadvantaged Communities in the San Joaquin Valley and Analyze Economically Feasible Options to Increase Access to Affordable Energy in those Disadvantaged Communities](http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M199/K979/199979978.PDF)". Unfortunately, at least [one pilot in California City](https://www.socalgas.com/1443741594585/Exhibit-5---SoCalGas-Pilot-Project-Proposal-for-California-City--Revised-.pdf) is moving forward with natural gas infrastructure, seemingly because of bureaucratic issues related to the electricity alternative. We would recommend that the City of Stockton stay actively involved in this CPUC project by providing comments on the upcoming phases and advocating for further pilo ts in Stockton and its peripheral rural areas to involve electrification. 

The Rocky Mountain Institute produced a report in 2018 titled ["The Economics of Electrifying Buildings"](https://rmi.org/insight/the-economics-of-electrifying-buildings/). This report includes Oakland as the most geographically proximate case study with estimates of average annual tCO2e reduction and net $ savings for every household that converts under different initial conditions, which will be modeled for Stockton. Their overall recommendations include:

- **Prioritize rapid electrification of buildings currently using propane and heating oil**. This is more relevant in East Coast case studies, but the possible benefits to Stockton were described above.
- **Stop supporting the expansion of the natural gas distribution system, including for new homes**. Our model will consider the impacts of policies to ban natural gas in new buildings. It will be important to learn from the experience of the City of Berkeley which voted to ban natural gas in new buildings in 2019 but is currently [facing a lawsuit](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/21/781874235/california-restaurant-industry-group-sues-berkeley-over-natural-gas-ban) from the California Restaurant Association.
- **Bundle demand flexibility programs, new rate designs, and energy efficiency with electrification initiatives**. Stockton should particularly focus on incentives for both creating the local skilled workforce of HVAC contractors, as well as rebates for homeowners. RMI notes: "Heat pump water heaters make up less than 1% of water heater sales today, and their unsubsidized purchase prices are two or more times those of natural gas water heaters. Given the current immaturity of the market for these products, and the potential for significant economies of scale with increasing market share, their costs are likely to decline in the future. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Electrification Futures Study projects cost declines of 20-38% for air-source heat pumps and 42-48% for heat pump water heaters by 2050. Likewise, in regions where contractors are currently unfamiliar with heat pump products, increasing scale and familiarity may reduce installation costs in the future." Electrification of specific high-consumption appliances like water and space heaters also may be combined with "smart appliance" capabilities that enable demand response, discussed next.

The following are case studies of electrification incentive programs from other cities. It is notable that none were found that specifically focus on workforce training, which is an opportunity for Stockton to differentiate itself.

- [Sacramento Municipal Utility District](https://www.smud.org/en) has an All-Electric Smart Home Program, part of the SMUD Smart Home Program, in which participating homeowners receive the financial incentives for single and multi-family homes shown in the table below. The minimum requirements include: all electric appliances and mechanical systems; no gas line in the home; and no gas service at the property. The public-private partnership has reached more than 1,000 homes and is expected to reach 2,000 by the end of the year.

| Type | Standard Incentive | Induction cooking appliance bonus | Total possible incentives |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Single-family unit | \$4,000 | \$1,000 | $5,000 |
| Multifamily unit | \$1,250 | \$500 | \$1,750 |

- [MassCEC](https://www.masscec.com/installer-resources-air-source-heat-pumps) provides incentives for residential installation of whole-home air-source heat pumps. Pilot funding for the project is still being allocated so the number of affected homes is not yet recorded. Incentives are based on income category: For >120% of state median income, \$2,500; for 80-120%, \$3,750; for <80% or affordable housing, \$5,000.
- [City of Palo Alto Utilities](https://cityofpaloalto.org/gov/depts/utl/residents/save_energy_n_water/rebates/heat_pump_water_heater/pilot_program_details.asp) offers rebates with the following eligibility requirements: To participate in the program, you must be a CPAU customer replacing a gas or electric water heater or installing a HPHW in a new or remodeled home; The HPHW must abide by the technical specifications listed by CPAU or must be on the list of Energy Star certified HPHWs.

The City of Palo Alto commissioned a [2016 study by TRC Energy Services](https://www.cityofpaloalto.org/civicax/filebank/documents/55069) which modeled the costs and impact of electrifying air and space gas heaters with heat pumps. 

The pasted figure below shows results for their model combining simulations of retrofitting a typical existing single family residential home of either one-story 2,100 or two-story 2,700 sqft in Palo Alto's climate zone (CZ4). 

```{r electrification-screenshot-1, fig.cap="Figure from the City of Palo Alto's 2016 Electrification study. Single family retrofit."}
include_graphics("images/electrification-1.png")
```

$~$

In the row labeled "Heat pump package (gas storage baseline)", which describes a replacement of both an air and space gas heater with electric heat pumps, the modeled impact on annual energy consumption is an increase of electricity use by 3,680 kWh (because gas appliances have been replaced with electric appliances) and a decrease of gas use by 445 therms. This comes at a net cost to customers of $6,094.  

Converting kWh and therms to kBTU and tCO2e yields the following:

**Single Family Residential Retrofit**

| Description | Amount |
|:------|:------|
| kBTU in one kWh | 3.4 |
| kBTU in one therm | 100 |
| kBTU electricity added per customer | 12,600 |
| kBTU gas saved per customer | 44,500 |
| lb CO2 in one electricity kWh (in 2020) | 0.1875 |
| lb CO2 in one gas therm | 11.7 |
| tCO2e electricity added per customer | 0.4 |
| tCO2e gas saved per customer | 2.4 |
| net tCO2e saved per customer | 2.0 |

The study also produced the same kinds of estimates for electrification in low-rise multifamily (7,000 sqft, two-story, 8 units) and small office (5,500 sqft, two-story) buildings (medium office building retrofits were considered to be significantly cost-prohibitive).

Note the following caveats:

- Stockton's climate zone (CZ12) experiences cooler winters and a greater number of heating degree days than Palo Alto, so the estimated savings for electrification should be even greater than estimated in Palo Alto. 
- In the estimates above, electricity use is converted to tCO2e using 2020 emissions factors from PG&E. In 2040, if we assume that PG&E has reduced its electricity emissions factor to 0, then the savings for single family, multifamily, and small office buildings increase to 2.4, 7.3, and 4.0, respectively.
- Stockton's single family housing stock is larger on average than Palo Alto's, so savings should also be greater than estimated due to size.

The findings suggest that electrification of existing single family and multifamily residential buildings is a significant market and GHG reduction strategy. 

In Section 2.10, we modeled the business-as-usual trends in energy efficiency and estimated that residential gas use per capita would naturally drop by 50% from 2020 to 2040 (while electricity use would naturally drop by 30%), based on the trends from 2013 to 2018. It is possible that some of this business-as-usual reduction is due to the natural replacement of old air and space gas heaters with more energy-efficient gas appliances or with electric appliances. But a proactive electrification campaign can be targeted towards those least likely to pursue electrification, either because of income or tensureship (renter as opposed to owner), and the estimated 2.0 tCO2/customer savings by 2040 either represents an entirely new set of households that wouldn't have otherwise electrified, or a set of households that was encouraged to electrify a few years earlier than they would have. 

Note that the City of Palo Alto study estimated that the electrification work would not lead to a net savings for customers, and instead cost them \$6,000 (single family) to \$34,000 (multifamily building owner) over the lifetime of the system. This likely represents the major barrier to electrification for residential customers. The City of Stockton could provide rebates to customers to reduce the cost of electrification in Stockton (which may be similar to Palo Alto's estimate but deserves its own professional analysis outside the scope of this report), as well as educate residents about the health and environmental benefits of electrification.

The total environmental impact, as well as the impact on local jobs and public funding, depends on the number of retrofits that can be completed. As a ballpark estimate, Section 2.10 estimates the business-as-usual savings in annual residential tCO2e from 2020 to 2040 as 108,000. If these were entirely attributable to electrification retrofits (though in reality, energy efficiency improves would also include improvements many other factors), this would be equivalent to 36,000 single family homes (1,800 per year, 46% of total) and 5,500 multifamily buildings (275 per year), and the remaining gas footprint in 2040 would be equivalent to an additional 44,000 single family homes and 6,700 multifamily buildings yet to electrify.

According to the [U.S. Department of Energy's Better Buildings Neighborhood Program](https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/betterbuildings/neighborhoods/pdfs/bbnp_business_models_guide.pdf), a typical HVAC contractor employs around 10-15 employees and should target an average of 500 service contracts to be a sustainable business. So, the estimated range of high-wage jobs that could be sustained through electrification projects alone range from 50 to 100. The City of Stockton could support these workers by subsidizing training (or partnering with product manufacturers who have an incentive to provide free training so as to promote their products), helping to connect HVAC contractors to prospective customers, and providing additional business licensing and tax incentives.

As previously noted in Section 2.4, only 24% of Stockton high-wage construction workers work in Stockton. And Section 2.7 further notes that Stockton's high-wage construction workers have an average commute footprint of 10.1 tCO2e. If the City of Stockton can specifically grow a local electrification workforce by bringing existing high-wage construction workers back to a new market within Stockton, then not only does the strategy lead to GHG reduction in electrified buildings, but also GHG reduction in commuting of approximately 500-1000 tCO2e/year. This second-order effect of localizing jobs is covered more systematically as a Local Jobs strategy.

# Conclusion
